### Comparative Literature
I guess this branch is the one that you might want to look at (though once you mentioned that maybe you might not be competitive to natives and might lose interest if taking it as a major).

[Courses related to Comparative Literature](https://dlcl.stanford.edu/departments/comparative-literature/courses)

[Graduate program](https://dlcl.stanford.edu/departments/comparative-literature/graduate-program). I am wondering whether they offer master level or not. Ph.D. seems to be... everlasting and impossible to apply.

## Theater &amp; Performance Studies (TAPS)
I am wondering whether this is one of your interests or not. See [homepage](http://taps.stanford.edu) and [course page](http://taps.stanford.edu/courses.html).
